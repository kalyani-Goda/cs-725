### Submitted solution to the assignment in file [submission.ipynb]
- Created a neural Network using the **NumPy** library, which inputs music data as mentioned in [README.md] and predicts the year it was released.
- We used MSE loss along with **L2-Regularization** to train the model. We also used **learning rate decay** and **input normalization** to preprocess the data.
- The model achieved an RMSE of 10.13 on the provided test data.
